📊 GitHub User and Repository Data Analysis

📝 Overview of Data Scraping
-> The data was scraped using the GitHub API, filtering users by their city and follower count. Detailed user information and repository data were then retrieved and stored in separate CSV files.

💡 Interesting Insight
-> It was surprising to find that a significant number of highly-followed GitHub users (over 100 followers) are not affiliated with any company, with 5 out of 30 users indicating no company affiliation.

📈 Actionable Recommendation
-> For better engagement, consider adding project snippets and screenshots—I haven’t done this much myself yet, but I plan to start incorporating them for my main projects to make them more engaging.
